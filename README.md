# Analyzing AWS Load Balancer Logs

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for "Analyzing AWS Load Balancer Logs: A Quick Guide with Over 80 Essential Queries Using Amazon Athena". This repository is a direct extension of my book, providing you with easy access to all the example queries mentioned and ensuring they stay up-to-date and accurate.

## About the Book

This guide is the result of my extensive experience with AWS services, focusing on the analysis of Application Load Balancer (ALB) access logs using Amazon Athena. Noticing the lack of comprehensive resources for effectively using Athena for ALB log analysis, I compiled this handbook from my experiences, insights, and the many hours spent unlocking actionable insights from ALB logs.

The book is designed for Systems Administrators, Application Developers, BI Analysts, and anyone interested in mastering Amazon Athena for log analysis. It equips you with practical skills to query and derive insights from ALB access logs, covering a wide range of scenarios for a thorough understanding.
